This: I'm andrew and I'm updating this markdown file here.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

gc_df <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")

gc_df

```

We are asking: Is there a significant difference in recommended gun control action for male and female correspondents, where the question is, should guns be easier, harder, or the same difficulty to get?

Hey Andrew love this question - real insightful 

Thanks Sara, you're a real team player, and I value your contributions to our project.
